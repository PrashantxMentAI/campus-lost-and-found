    "reasoning": "Given the requirements for a simple \"Lost and Found Board\" application with no authentication, the most straightforward and secure Firestore structure is to use a single collection, `/lost_found_items`. Since there is no user authentication, all items are essentially public. To support the AI-powered auto-categorization, the `category` field is included within the `LostFoundItem` entity. A semantic search is best handled outside of Firestore rules and queries, so the database structure does not directly address it. This design achieves Authorization Independence because no rules depend on any other document. There is no authentication, so all reads and writes are public, and there is no need for denormalization. This trivially satisfies the QAP because `list` operations are permitted for everyone."
